## Django Tests

Testing can be divided into two main categories: unit and integration. Unit tests check a piece of functionality in isolation, while Integration tests check multiple pieces linked together. Unit tests run faster and are easier to maintain since they focus on only a small piece of code. Integration tests are slower and harder to maintain since a failure doesnâ€™t point you in the specific direction
of the cause. Most developers focus on writing many unit tests and a small amount of integration tests.
Generally speaking, SimpleTestCase is used when a database is not necessary while TestCase
is used when you do want to test the database. TransactionTestCase is useful if you need to
directly test database transactions while LiveServerTestCase launches a live server thread useful for testing with browser-based tools like Selenium.
